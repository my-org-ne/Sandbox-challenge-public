# In AWS, security groups act as virtual firewalls. Misconfiguring them by allowing unrestricted ingress (e.g., open to all IPs) can make your infrastructure 
# vulnerable to attacks. Here’s an example using boto3 to create a security group with an open inbound rule.
# Setting CidrIp: '0.0.0.0/0' means any IP address can access any port on this resource.

    )
    security_group_id = response['GroupId']
